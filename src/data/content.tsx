      Internal Family Systems (IFS) is a psychotherapy approach developed by Richard C. Schwartz in the 1980s. The model views the mind as an inner family made up of distinct “parts,” each with its own perspective and feelings. These parts interact with one another much like family members, sometimes cooperating and sometimes competing for control of the person’s behavior.

      IFS groups parts into categories based on how they try to protect us. “Managers” work to keep daily life functioning smoothly and prevent painful emotions from surfacing. When distress does break through, “Firefighters” leap in to douse the intensity, often through impulsive or distracting behaviors. Hidden beneath these protectors are “Exiles,” vulnerable parts that carry burdens of trauma, shame, or fear.

      At the heart of the system is the Self—a calm, compassionate state that embodies curiosity, confidence, and clarity. Therapy aims to help individuals access this Self so it can lead the internal family. When the Self is in charge, protective parts can relax and wounded parts can release the burdens they carry.
    </p>

      IFS therapy involves “unblending” from strong emotions, listening to each part’s positive intent, and fostering a trusting relationship between the Self and the parts. By doing so, people often experience more inner harmony and relief from symptoms related to trauma, anxiety, and other mental health concerns. The approach has grown beyond its clinical roots and is now applied in coaching, spirituality, and personal growth contexts.
